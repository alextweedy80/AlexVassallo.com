                As a recent graduate from the University of Washington, I am seeking to apply my new abilities to the workforce.
                I would like to focus my career on Embedded Systems, however my diverse range of software studies would allow me to contribute in many different areas.

                                    His tireless work ethic, dedication to his platoon and desire to be the best, while freely sharing his knowledge,
                                     has set the foundation for further success for the mortar platoon for years to come.&quot;
