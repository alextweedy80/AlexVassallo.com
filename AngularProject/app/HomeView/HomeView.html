                            <br />I am a fresh software engineer from the University of Washington
                            and this site is designed to share my personal research and to grow as I do.
                            This site is also designed to help push forward my professional career.
                            By publishing my research on here, I can show examples of
                            the technology that I am using, and expose
                            my professional level. These are my personal projects and I would love to
                            collaborate with other people who are interested in my research.<br /><br />
