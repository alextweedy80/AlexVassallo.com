                            <br />I am a fresh software engineer, born out the University of Washington,
                            and this site is designed to share my personal research and to grow as I do.
                            This site is also designed to help push forward my profesional career.
                            By publishing my research on here, everyone can see examples of
                            the technology that I am using, and get a better understanding of
                            my professional level. These are my personal projects and I freely share
                            the details of these projects to help other people who would like to
                            expand upon my research. Sharing is Caring.<br /><br />
