                This project took place while serving on duty during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The
                material used for construction was nothing more than the thin
                cardboard found on the back of our notepads, the lined paper from in it,
                superglue from the supply tent, paperclips, coffee straws,
                thumbtacks, cigarette cellophane, the hardware found in
                retractable pens. The electrical components were all scavanged from
                broken devices, such as microwaves, printers, etc. The one exception
                to local material was the 6 channel  R/C transmitter that a family
                member had specially shipped to me.<br /><br />

            The design began with detailed and scaled drawings done on graph paper. The airfoil chosen was a
            Clark 'Y' airfoil due to the high lift, slow stall speed, and overall
            simplicity requirements.  The width and length of the wings, (chord
            and wingspan), were designed to be short and stubby to allow for large error
            tolerances during construction and responsiveness of controls during
            flight, while maintaining appropriate surface area for the projected
            weight. The tail section was placed slightly closer to the center of
            gravity than normal, to allow for more responsive controls rather
            than overall stability during straight flight. The terrain that this
            craft would be landing on would normally be dirt and rock, so
            aluminum (soda cans) covered landing skids rather than wheels were
            chosen, and would be retractable due to the high drag they create.
            Lastly, because we had just captured a small mouse who had been
            caught attempting to steal from our food stash, it was decided that
            the mouse should 'pilot' this craft. Since no animals were harmed
            during this project, an ejection seat was designed in the case of
            catastrophic failure.<br /><br />

            These are the basic components for construction. Bulkheads and ribs were carefully cut out from the
            cardboard backings of my notepad books, and were typically 3-4 layers
            thick each. The spars and stringers were made by carefully drawing
            lines exactly 1/4 inch apart, and folding the paper into tight
            squares while using stick glue to harden it into place.

                        Fun fact: During the construction
                        of this airplane, I built a side project to help out our late night
                        gate guards. The electronics shown in these two top pictures was
                        scavenged from a broken R/C car. The transmitter was combined with
                        parts from a nightlight to transmit when a vehicle's headlights
                        shined upon it, and the receiver portion was combined with a peizo
                        speaker to alert them when a vehicle was approaching.<br /><br />

            The ejection seat sat on top of a
            platform that could be raised by pulling on a set of four strings.
            These strings were later attached to large rubber bands with a lock
            and release system to hold it under tension and explosively release.
            The inner parts of a pen were used as string guides to eliminate
            friction. The dual 9v batteries located in the nose were pulled
            forward during the ejection process to counter-balance the immediate
            loss of pilot weight.

            The forward retractable landing
            skid was constructed from outer pen casings and thumbtacks. It was
            designed to lock in place when fully extended and the small cardboard

            The wings were constructed on a
            large and perfectly flat surface. The center of the wing is
            reinforced by extra cardboard to prevent them folding up during

            paperclips as pushrods, which attach to a common servo. Bellcranks

            It may be noted that the color of
            the paper has changed to white. During construction, I was relocated
            to another station, which required me to dismantle most of the parts
            I had built. This new location had white notepads which I found much
            more aesthetically pleasing anyways. I reconstructed the tail section
            with this new paper. The elevator was built with a split surface
            design connected to a servo via coffee straws and paperclips, and the
            addition of LED navigation lights began. Cardboard was used to

        Here are the latches that held back
        the huge tension that ejected the seat. The latches were release by
        activating a motor connected to a gear box, (salvaged

            This latch was designed to hold down
            a large spring-loaded parachute box which was to be deployed in the
            event of radio failure. Military bases commonly used radio jammers to
            prevent missile and IED attacks. These jammers could completely
            disrupt radio communication with the airplane. This latch was
            designed as a multi-stage locking latch which could hold back a huge
            amount of tension, but be easily released by the small force applied

            The majority of the aircraft was
            now covered with normal white printer paper from the supply tent.
            The batteries for the motor were built into a disposable pod which
            sat streamlined on the belly, and made contact with two large metal
            connectors.  Due to weight, this battery pack was designed to be
            jettison before landing. The canopy openings were covered by
            cellophane from a pack of cigarettes. The landing skids were covered
            with aluminum from a soda can. A curved nose cone was carefully built
            by soaking cardboard in water and allowing it to dry around a mold,
