    This project was started and
    completed while serving on duty during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The
    material used for construction was nothing more than the thin
    cardboard found on the back of our notepads, the lined paper from it,
    superglue from the supply tent, paperclips, coffee straws,
    thumbtacks, cigarette cellophane, and the hardware found in
    retractable pens. The one exception to local material was the 6
    channel  R/C transmitter that a family member had specially shipped
    to me.

    This project began with detailed
    and scaled drawings done on graph paper. The airfoil chosen was a
    Clark 'Y' airfoil due to the high lift, slow stall speed, and overall
    simplicity requirements.  The width and length of the wings, (chord
    and wingspan), was designed short and stubby to allow for large error
    tolerances during construction and responsiveness of controls during
    flight, while maintaining appropriate surface area for the projected
    weight. The tail section was placed slightly closer to the center of
    gravity than normal, to allow for more responsive controls rather
    than overall stability during straight flight. The terrain that this
    craft would be landing on would normally be dirt and rock, so
    aluminum (soda cans) covered landing skids rather than wheels were
    chosen, and would be retractable due to the high drag they create.
    Lastly, because we had just captured a small mouse who had been
    caught attempting to steal from our food stash, it was decided that
    the mouse should 'pilot' this craft. Since no animals could be harmed
    during this project, an ejection seat was designed in the case of
    catastrophic failure.

    These are the basic components of
    constructions. Bulkheads and ribs were carefully cut out from the
    cardboard backings of my notepad books, and were typically 3-4 layers
    thick each. The spars and stringers were made by carefully drawing
    lines exactly 1/4&quot; apart, and folding the paper into tight
    squares while using stick glue to harden it into place.

        Fun fact: During the construction
        of this airplane, I built a side project to help out our late night
        gate guards. The electronics shown in these two top pictures was
        scavenged from a broken R/C car. The transmitter was combined with
        parts from a nightlight to transmit when a vehicle's headlights
        shined upon it, and the receiver portion was combined with a peizo
        speaker to alert them when a vehicle was approaching.

    The ejection seat sat on top of a
    platform that could be raised by pulling on a set of four strings.
    These strings were later attached to large rubber bands with a lock
    and release system to hold it under tension and explosively release.
    The inner parts of a pen were used as string guides to eliminate

    The wings were constructed on a

    reinforced by extra cardboard to prevent them folding up during
    flight. Large ailerons are controlled by using coffee straws and

    It may be noted that the color of
    the paper has changed to white. During construction, I was relocated
    to another station, which required me to dismantle most of the parts
    I had built. This new location had white notepads which I found much
    more aesthetically pleasing anyways. I reconstructed the tail section
    with this new paper. The elevator was built with a split surface
    design connected to a servo via coffee straws and paperclips, and the
    addition of LED navigation lights began. Cardboard was used to
    strengthen leading and trailing surfaces.

    The navigation lights followed the
    standard convention for aircraft. Green on the right, red on the
    left, red on the tail, a white strobe on the belly, and two super
    bright landing lights located inside of the forward skid compartment,
    which only turned on when the landing skids were fully extended..

    This latch was designed to hold down
    a large spring-loaded parachute box which was to be deployed in the
    event of radio failure. Military bases commonly used radio jammers to
    prevent missile and IED attacks. These jammers could completely
    disrupt radio communication with the airplane. This latch was
    designed as a multi-stage locking latch which could hold back a huge
    amount of tension, but be easily released by the small force applied
    by a microservo.<IMG SRC="Projects/IraqAirplane/img/i_50b3ccd0f5e6adab_html_e8b6eecc.jpg" NAME="Picture 74" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=352 HEIGHT=264 BORDER=0><IMG SRC="Projects/IraqAirplane/img/i_50b3ccd0f5e6adab_html_3f2879ec.jpg" NAME="Picture 75" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=263 BORDER=0>

    All the peices coming together. The
    wings connected to the fuselage via two large platic bolts, and a set
    of male and female connectors which perfectly aligned with each
    other. Two square blocks on the wing mated with two square holes on
    top of the fuselage to allow for easy installation.

    The majority of the aircraft was
    now covered with normal white printer paper from the supply tent.
    The batteries for the motor were built into a disposable pod which
    sat streamlined on the belly, and made contact with two large metal
    connectors.  Due to weight, this battery pack was designed to be
    jettison before landing. The canopy openings were covered by
    cellophane from a pack of cigarettes. The landing skids were covered
    with aluminum from a soda can. A curved nose cone was carefully built
    by soaking cardboard in water and allowing it to dry around a mold,
    then applying superglue to harden it into form.  All systems appeared
    to be working as expected.

    We then received notification that
    our tour in Iraq was complete. The aircraft was carefully packed up
    in a custom made box, tightly secured, and then mistaken as a
    malicious package and mostly destroyed. Here are the pictures of its
    final condition.
