        <p align="justify">
            This project was created as a final project for EE 205 Signal Conditioning
            class at the University of Washington. The assignment was to design
            an optical receiver using a photodiode to collect transmitted data
            from light that is being transmitted from a central base. The light
            source pulsed at either 3kHz to indicate 0, or 5kHz to indicate 1,
            and at various bitrates. The embedded data contained ASCII characters
            which could be displayed as text on a console via USB connection. The
            microcontroller we were required to use was an Arduino Uno, which has
            an analog sampling frequency just below the Nyquist frequency for a
            5kHz signal. The biggest challenge of the assignment was to detect
            that 5kHz signal. In response, I chose to develop a much larger front
            end circuit to perform the frequency detection, which used filters,
            peak detectors, and automatic gain control to convert the analog
            signal back into digital. Once I had a digital signal output to
            process, I was able to receive data at speeds well above
            expectations.  By monitoring voltage on the peak detectors the
            software controlled MOSFET gain control circuits.  The sensitivity
            could be automatically adjusted to reach very long distances, while
            still functioning at close range.

                The first stage is a
                trans-impedance amplifier to respond to current changes from the
                photodiode.  This amplifier feeds the next three variable gain
                stages, which are described in Figure 2.  Each variable gain stage is
                designed to roll-off frequencies above 10kHz using C1. The coupling
                capacitor C2 between each variable gain stage eliminates DC offset
                and provides a high pass filter. Each op-amp stage works in
                conjunction with a MOSFET that changes feedback resistance to raise
                or lower the gain. Each stage has been configured to allow switching
                between  a gain boost of 4<sup>x</sup>. By using  gains of 4<sup>1</sup>,
                4<sup>2</sup>, and 4<sup>4</sup>, any binary combination can be chosen to allow 
                various gains up to 4<sup>7</sup>. Gain is controlled from three digital outputs from the
                micro-controller.

            The next amplifier stage is a band-pass filter, which passes
            frequencies between 3kHz and 5kHz, and attenuates frequencies outside
            that range. A 4 pole butterworth filter design as shown in figures 3
            and 4 are used for high and low pass filtering of the band-pass. The
            -3dB points needed to balance the amplitudes of a 5kHz an 3kHz signal
            for comparison were experimentally discovered using simulators.  The
            calibrated roll-off frequencies were found to be 4kHz for the high
            pass and 3.5kHz for the low pass.  Since they slightly overlap, there
            were symmetric and steep response slopes on both sides of the 4kHz

            Two more 4-pole butterworth filters, one
            high and one low pass, separate the 3kHz and 5kHz sinusoidal signals
            into separate channels. Each filter rolls off right at 4kHz in
            opposite directions to split our frequency range right down the
            middle. By connecting each filter output to a full wave precision
            rectifiers we can measure the levels of each frequency within the
            signal. Using a full wave rectifier allows double the amount of
            positive waveform samples to feed into our peak detector, which
            allows more samples to be used with faster sampling times.

            up C1 and C2, which are continuously discharging through R1 and R2 to
            ground. The charging and draining of C1 and C2 must support bitrates
            up to 1kHz, which means our sample period lasts 1ms and capacitors
            should be able to discharge 60% within half of the bit period.  A
            comparator measures the voltage of C1 and C2 and outputs high or low
            accordingly.

            Automatic gain control is accomplished by monitoring the voltage levels of C1
            and C2. Whichever voltage is higher is used to determines the gain
            adjustments required. If the highest voltage drops below 0.5V, the
            gain is increased by a factor of 4, bringing the voltage up to 2V.
            Similarly, if the voltage is above 3.5V, the gain is reduced by a
            factor of 4 to bring it down to 1.2V. The scaling factor of 4 was
            chosen exactly for this behavior.

            The final comparator uses the 5V power
            rail and the -9V power rail from the batteries to output the proper
            voltage level.  A diode is used to block the negative voltage for our
            square wave and a resistor is used to pull the data pin to ground
            when the diode is not conducting. The final result of the hardware is
            a clean digital signal that represents the strongest frequency
            detected by our photodiode.

                        Since the hardware can raise and lower

                        value to control the volume of the gain boost.  Just like a binary
                        system, the amplification factor of each gain stage increases
                        exponentially to represent its bit position. The 3 gain switches can
                        be arranged into a 3 bit integer, of values 0 to 7, that can be

                        To determine if the volume, or gain, is
                        out of range, the software must monitor two analog outputs from the
                        peak detectors. The highest value of the two is compared against
                        predefined range limits, (0.5V to 3.5V), and the volume is
                        incremented or decremented accordingly.  The response time of the
                        gain control is less than the loop cycle time of the software, so
                        volume can be adjusted by 1 each loop cycle.  LEDs connected to each
                        binary output show the currently selected binary combination, thus
                        the current level of gain boost.

        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
            To measure and synchronize with the incoming data stream, an
            auto-configuration function was built.  This took the most time to
            develop. It begins by attaching interrupt routines to both falling
            and rising edge detectors. Since both edges cannot be monitored
            simultaneously by the hardware, each interrupt routine must enable
            the other in a back-and-forth fashion.  This allows those interrupt
            routines to mark the exact times of each data-line voltage
            transition.

        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
                Figure 8 shows the equation style we use
                to find the bit time.  The unknown variables are both x and the
                coefficients.  Knowing the format of the byte message, we can use a
                &quot;best fit&quot; algorithm to find the coefficient variables by
                1) assigning x to the smallest time found, 2) measuring time between
                bits and bytes, 3) verifying start and stop bits, and 4) using
                previously acquired synchronization values.  If the coefficient
                variables are not whole numbers, we can use that variation to simply
                measure the error or drastically change the timing values.

                Using this hardware and software
                package, I was able to easily reach the 1kHz bit rate target. The
                maximum range achieved before auto-configuration could no longer
                detect a signal was over 10 feet with this design.  At that range,
                physical alignment seemed to be the most difficult problem.  The
                single LED transmitter station was extremely omni-directional.
                During the final test in the lab, I was able to receive 1000 messages
                with a few minor errors at 10 feet. The &quot;Miss Rate&quot; was
                less than 1% and hard to measure.

                Auto-configure routines were
                able to seek bit rates as low as 20Hz, and above 1kHz.  The average
                packet misses while recalibrating was usually only 1, but up to 4
                when large timing transitions took place. Overall the
                auto-configuration was very impressive.  It can determine bit rates
                within an accuracy of 10 micro-seconds,  total message size, and any
                extra or missing bits. It was also allowed to make minor adjustments
                to current variables to compensate for any drift. When the signal was
                lost or changed, it immediately began to measure the new bit time,
                verify the signal, verify the packet, and re-synchronizes with it.
